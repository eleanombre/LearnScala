# A list of resources for learning Scala

## Resources:

1. https://www.scala-exercises.org/ (particularly std lib)
2. (Please PR to add more suggestions to this list)

After I had gone through the [std lib exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/std_lib/asserts) I completed codewars kata, experimenting with scala in the terminal.
These are the Kata I used that worked well for Scala.
